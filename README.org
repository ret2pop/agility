* Introduction
Agility is a nix-on-droid system that aims to act like a versatile downloader for
different kinds of media, including git repositories, tarballs, and youtube videos.
To install, install ~git~ on your nix-on-droid installation.
** Why?
It's obviously true that using a terminal on a phone is not ideal. However, as it
stands right now, it is the most versatile way to execute common applications like
~rsync~ or ~git~ while allowing other applications on the phone to be able to read your
downloaded material. In my experience, doing this is very difficult without either
nix-on-droid or Termux, and because I use NixOS, I figured nix-on-droid was the
correct choice.

Note that I use this in conjunction with my monorepo and Orgo in order to read
my Latex org mode files offline.
